# Leveraging Sentiment Analysis for Enhanced Brand Management
## Business Understanding

Effective brand management involves not only monitoring brand mentions but also discerning the underlying emotions expressed by consumers. Positive sentiments signify brand advocacy, while negative sentiments may indicate dissatisfaction or potential issues. Moreover, understanding the target audience's emotional connection with the brand aids in crafting personalized marketing campaigns and product offerings. Sentiment analysis serves as a strategic tool for branding managers to gauge consumer sentiment accurately and tailor brand strategies accordingly, ultimately driving brand growth and profitability.

Futhermore, sentiment analysis allows brands to move beyond guesswork in their branding efforts.  By analyzing customer emotions, brand managers can tailor messaging and campaigns to resonate with their target audience. This data-driven approach fosters brand loyalty, increases customer satisfaction, and ultimately drives sales growth.  Imagine a brand manager using sentiment analysis to identify a negative customer perception about a product feature.  This insight can be used to refine the product or messaging, demonstrating the brand's responsiveness to customer feedback

## Problem Statement
In the rapidly evolving technology market, understanding customer sentiment towards products is crucial for companies like Google and Apple. These insights can guide product development, marketing strategies, customer service, and more. However, manually analysing customer sentiment is a time-consuming and labour-intensive process. Given the vast amount of customer feedback available on platforms like Twitter, it is virtually impossible for humans to process all the data in a timely manner. Moreover, human analysis is subject to bias and inconsistency, and the quality of analysis can vary greatly depending on the individualâ€™s understanding and interpretation. This makes it difficult to scale and standardize the sentiment analysis process. Therefore, there is a need for an automated, efficient, and reliable solution to analyse customer sentiment towards Google and Apple products. Machine Learning, with its ability to learn patterns from large datasets and make predictions, offers a promising solution to this problem. By applying Machine Learning techniques for sentiment analysis, we can process vast amounts of data in a fraction of the time it would take a human. This not only saves time and resources but also provides consistent and unbiased analysis. Furthermore, Machine Learning models can continuously learn and improve over time, adapting to new trends and nuances in customer sentiment.

## Key Objectives
 1. Utilize Natural Language Processing techniques to construct a machine learning model for automated sentiment analysis of tweets related to Google and Apple products.
 2. Evaluate and select the most suitable machine learning model for sentiment analysis based on its performance metrics.
 3. Analyse frequency of the sentiments expressed in tweets about Google and Apple products.

## Data Understanding

The dataset, sourced from CrowdFlower via data.world, comprises over 9,000 tweets with sentiment ratings labeled as positive, negative, or neutral by human raters. The dataset contains three columns:

  - `tweet_text`: This column contains the text of the tweet, facilitating sentiment analysis based on the content itself.

  - `emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at`: This column indicates whether the expressed emotion pertains to a specific brand or product. It enables targeted sentiment analysis tailored to the brand's performance.

  - `is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product (target variable)`: This column serves as a quick indicator of brand-related sentiment, allowing for efficient initial filtering of relevant data.
